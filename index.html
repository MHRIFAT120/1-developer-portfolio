                jannat..If we want to jannat ,we have to main rules and regulation ,which given by allah the almighty
                and our beloved prophet mohammad
                (sm.).First and foremost work we have to do pray five times salat everyday,and recite al-quran as we
                can.good manner with parent's, teacher and so on.we have to save us from haram relationship, fitnah,jena
                and all the bad habit's.
                Our income should be halal...if we want any thing, we directly told allah through munajahh.
                we have to live dunniah's life only for achieving JANNAT.IN SHA ALLAH ,ALLAH will save us from all the
                bed deeds and haram things. </p>
